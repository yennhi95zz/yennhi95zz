# üí´ About Me
Hi there!

My name is Nhi and I am a Data Scientist with a background in Finance. I started my journey in Data Science and Machine Learning from scratch, so I understand the challenges that beginners in this field face.

I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and helping others learn. That's why I write blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/@yennhi95zz) and create DS/ML projects on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nhiyen/code) & [Github](https://github.com/yennhi95zz) to explain the complexities of data in a simple and approachable way. I hope that my work is helpful to beginners in the field and that it inspires them to keep learning and growing.
